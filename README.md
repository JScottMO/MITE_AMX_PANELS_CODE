# MITE_AMX_PANELS_CODE

This is some AMX Code for a client of mine, MITE network, who has Netlix controllers and Panels from AMX. Posting for reference and archive. 
-A neat feature-The NI panels boot and figure out what site their are at based on IP address and then are able to load any custome setting based on that .
